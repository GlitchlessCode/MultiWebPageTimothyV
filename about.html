            <h3>Formation</h3>
            <!-- List of Info -->
            <ul>
                <li>Black holes are formed usually through one of two events. Usually, either a giant star imploding
                    under its own weight, or two neutron stars colliding will cause a black hole to appear. Both of
                    these events will cause a spectacular implosion, usually moving upwards of 70 000 km/s (a.k.a. 23%
                    the speed of light) towards their center.</li>
                <br>

                <li>The force of this implosion will result in one of two things. Either it will form a black hole, or
                    sometimes it will form a neutron star(A star made entirely of a thick neutron soup).</li>
                <br>

                <li>If it does form a black hole, that means that the large majority of that starâ€™s mass is contained
                    within either a singularity, or even a ringularity.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Subheader -->
            <h3>Singularities</h3>
            <!-- List of Info -->
            <ul>
                <li>The singularity of a black hole is where 100% of its mass is located, contained within a point(or
                    ring), with a volume of 0.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Point singularities exist only within non-rotating black holes, whereas ring singularities are the
                    center of rotating black holes. This is because an infinitely small point cannot spin, whereas a
                    ring can.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <!-- Subheader -->
            <h3">Ergosphere</h3>
            <!-- List of Info -->
            <ul>
                <li>An ergosphere is a region of space that only appears around rotating black holes, those with ring
                    singularities. When within the ergosphere, it is impossible to stay completely still, because the
                    rotating black hole drags around spacetime, causing massive ripples, forcing objects within the
                    ergosphere to move.</li>
                <br>

                <li>While inside the ergosphere, the closer you are to the event horizon, the faster you need to go to
                    escape the ergosphere again, otherwise, you will inevitably be sucked in.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Subheader -->
            <h3>Photon Sphere</h3>
            <!-- List of info -->
            <ul>
                <li>The photon sphere is a region of space in which many photons are trapped in a theoretically infinite
                    orbit around the black hole. However, their orbits are very unstable. Any external disturbance will
                    either send it flying out of the photon sphere back into space, or spiraling down into the event
                    horizon, disappearing forever.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Fun Facts About Black Holes</h2>

            <!-- List of info -->
            <ul>
                <li>Technically, black holes are not infinite. They slowly radiate away their mass through a process
                    known as Hawking Radiation(Named after Stephen Hawking, who originally theorised the process of this
                    radiation). This process gets faster the smaller the black hole is, and so eventually, a black hole
                    can get to a size where in less than a nanosecond, it radiates away the entirety of its remaining
                    mass, exploding with a tremendous amount of force and energy.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Despite how dangerous these interstellar monsters can appear to be, the chance of earth itself
                    falling into a black hole is essentially 0. For instance, the closest black hole at this time is
                    theorised to be about 20 000 light years away, or about 189 214 620 000 000 000 km away from the
                    earth.</li>
                <br>

                <li>All sorts of weird things can start to happen the closer you get to the event horizon, due to a
                    variety of effects, including gravitational time dilation. This is when something appears to
                    move/occur slower, the closer to an extremely massive object it is. Therefore, in theory, to an
                    external observer, it would take an infinite amount of time for something to fall into a black hole.
                </li>
            </ul>
